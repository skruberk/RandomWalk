This code simulates a random walk in 2D with reflective boundaries to one (target random walk ) or multiple (polymerase random walk) targets to model the way an actin filament tip interacts with a membrane surface. Any code labeled "runs" allows the code to run multiple times and generates as histogram. 
The walk is effectively a diffusing point tied by an elastic spring to the center. Elastic spring modeled in files named "elasticspring" for a plot of the randomwalk and "elasticspringruns" to generate the histogram
